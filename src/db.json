Patients achieving no response receive GM-CSF for an additional 3 months. Patients failing to achieve a partial response or better after the second course of GM-CSF are removed from the study. Patients achieving a partial response after the first or second course of GM-CSF continue to receive GM-CSF for an additional 9 months. Patients are then re-evaluated. Patients achieving a complete cytologic response at 9 months then receive GM-CSF 3 times weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients are followed every 2 weeks.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."

The biomarkers of exposure will be measured in blood and urine samples collected from the subjects. Moreover, the biomarkers in subjects smoking conventional or SMAR cigarettes will be compared with those biomarkers in smokers who stop smoking for 5 days. The short term safety of this new product will also be evaluated.",

Subjects will be discharged in the morning of D6. From the discharge of the subject, a 7-day safety follow-up period will be carried out (until D13)."

Determine whether genistein treatment will decrease the number of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in the peripheral blood as measured by qRT-PCR for PSA performed on RNA extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine the natural history of circulating prostate cells (CPCs) in a cohort of subjects prior to and post radical prostatectomy.\n\nII. Compare the measurement of PSA between three separate methods: in CPCs by qRT-PCR, in serum by the standard clinical chemistry assay (i.e., ELISA), and in plasma and serum by the nano-PSA assay.\n\nIII. Measure the effect of genistein on gene and protein expression in prostate tissue by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively, for the following genes and their respective protein products: HSP27, MMP-2, ALK-2, BASP1, and HCF2.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive oral genistein once daily for 3 months beginning at least 1 month prior to radical prostatectomy.\n\nARM II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 3 months beginning at least 1 month prior to radical prostatectomy.\n\nAll patients undergo radical prostatectomy at least 2 weeks, but not more than 3 months following the start of therapy.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 6, and 12 months."
